# vrchat_world.py
A Simple CLI Python Script that outputs information about a VRChat World by inputting their ID. 
This was more of a test project I used to poke around the VRChat API. 

# Installation

## Ubuntu

Your OS should have python preinstalled♥️

All you need to do is:

## Windows

Your OS does NOT ship with python preinstalled💀💀💀

Therefore, you get extra steps!🤗🤗🤗Yay!!🎉🎉🎉💀💀💀

### Installing Python

### What if I accidently clicked "Install Now" without checking the "Add python.exe to PATH" in the beginning?

After closing the setup window, reopen the executable. You should be greeted with a window that looks like this:
